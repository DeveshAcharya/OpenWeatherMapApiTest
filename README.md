# OpenWeatherMapApiTest
Welcome to the Test Suite for OpenWeatherApi forecast endpoint.

## Getting Started

Its quite striaght forward to get started once you clone the repo.
- Open the solution in visual studio and build the solution.
- Place the apikey credential file "AppSettingsSecrets.config" provded in the folder "C:\OpenWeatheMapApiTest"
- If you want to change the location just replace the file location in the app.config where you are placing the credential file.  (unfortunatly it doesn't allow relative paths.)
- Run the tests in visual studio test runner.
